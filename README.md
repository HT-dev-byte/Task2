# Task2
Created a responsive web page using HTML and CSS to build a contact form with input fields such as name, email, and message. JavaScript is used for form validation to ensure correct data entry. DOM manipulation is demonstrated by implementing a dynamic to-do list where users can add and remove tasks, providing interactivity with the webpage.
